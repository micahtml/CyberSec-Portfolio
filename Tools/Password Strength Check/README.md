# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple tool built using Python that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, character types, and complexity. It provides a score and rating to indicate the strength of the password.

## Features

- Checks password length and assigns a score.
- Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Calculates a final score based on the above criteria.
- Provides a rating indicating the strength of the password.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the source code files are located.
3. Run the following command to execute the program:
'''python
python password_strength_checker.py

4. Enter the password when prompted.
5. The program will display the password strength rating or any error messages if the password does not meet the requirements.

## Customization

You can customize the password requirements or modify the rating system based on your needs by editing the source code file `password_strength_checker.py`. 

Here are some possible customizations:

- Adjust the length requirement by changing the value in the line `if len(password) >= 8:` (change `8` to your desired length).
- Modify the regular expressions in the `check_password_strength` function to include or exclude specific character types.
- Update the rating system in the `rate_password_strength` function to suit your preferences.
